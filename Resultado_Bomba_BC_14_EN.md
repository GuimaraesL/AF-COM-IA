**Failure Analysis Report: Bearing Assembly**

**Visible Damage:**

*   **Bearing Inner Race:** Exhibits catastrophic failure with gross, multi-point fractures and extensive material loss, particularly on the retaining shoulders. Severe abrasive wear and spalling are evident on the raceway surface. Significant dark discoloration (bluing/blackening) is present, consistent with thermal damage.
*   **Bearing Outer Race:** Displays widespread spalling, pitting, and abrasive wear on the rolling surface. Dark discoloration is also present, though less severe than on the inner race.
*   **Rolling Elements (Cylindrical Rollers):** Show signs of heavy abrasive wear, pitting, and significant discoloration (darkening) on their rolling surfaces.
*   **Bearing Cage/Retainer:** Severely deformed, fractured, and fragmented, with large sections missing. Fragments of metallic material from the cage are visible.
*   **Lubrication:** Minimal remnants of blue-colored grease are present, but it is heavily contaminated with metallic wear debris and appears degraded. There is a clear absence of sufficient, clean lubricant.
*   **Metallic Debris:** Abundant, dark, shredded, and granular metallic swarf and particles are distributed throughout the entire bearing cavity, indicating severe material loss from the bearing components.
*   **Housing Flange:** Extensive reddish-brown corrosion (rust) is present on the machined surface of the surrounding cast housing flange and extending into the bearing bore interface.

**Location:**

*   All severe wear, fractures, and thermal damage are concentrated within the internal components of the bearing assembly (inner race, outer race, rollers, and cage).
*   Metallic debris is heavily distributed within the bearing's operating cavity.
*   Corrosion is localized on the external interface of the cast housing flange surrounding the bearing.

**Characteristics:**

*   **Wear:** Severe, uneven, deep spalling, and abrasive patterns are present on both raceways, indicative of surface fatigue and severe metal-to-metal contact.
*   **Fractures:** Gross, multi-point, and brittle-appearing fractures on the inner race and cage suggest high stress, potential overload, and material fatigue leading to catastrophic structural failure.
*   **Discoloration:** The dark brown to black coloration on the bearing components points to significant overheating and lubricant degradation. The rust on the housing is a widespread, reddish-brown superficial layer.
*   **Debris:** The high quantity of shredded and granular metallic particles indicates advanced, severe material detachment from the bearing elements.
*   **Lubricant:** The visible lubricant is sparse, heavily laden with dark particulate contamination, and has lost its functional integrity.

**Observation Report: Equipment Condition Based on Lubricant Analysis**

**Visible Damage (inferred from lubricant analysis report):**

*   **Wear (Material Degradation):**
    *   **Metal Loss:** The lubricant sample exhibits a "moderate concentration of Iron" and an "increase in concentration of Copper and Lead." This indicates active material removal from ferrous (steel) components and non-ferrous components, commonly associated with bearing alloys (e.g., bronze, babbitt).
    *   **Wear Particle Morphology:** Microscopic analysis (Ferrography) identified the dominant presence of "particles with severe/abrasive wear morphology," along with a "lesser proportion of fatigue particles." This signifies active, mechanically induced material removal and surface degradation processes within the equipment.

*   **Contamination:**
    *   **Particulate Contamination:** The lubricant displays a critically high particulate count, classified as "ISO 4406: 22/20/17." The report explicitly mentions the "presence of fiber and dirt particles" within the sample.
    *   **Water Ingress:** A significant water concentration of "1050 ppm (Karl Fischer)" is reported, indicating substantial moisture contamination.

*   **Lubricant Degradation:**
    *   **Viscosity Change:** The lubricant's viscosity has undergone a "15% increase," suggesting potential oxidation, thermal degradation, or contamination with a heavier fluid.
    *   **Additive Anomaly:** "High concentration of Phosphorus and Zinc" is noted, which could indicate issues with the additive package or a lubricant cross-contamination event.

**Location (inferred from analysis data):**

*   **Bearings/Bushings:** The increased levels of Copper and Lead, along with fatigue wear particles, strongly infer active wear on non-ferrous bearing surfaces.
*   **Rotating/Sliding Steel Components:** The moderate concentration of Iron and the prevalence of abrasive wear particles suggest material loss from steel components such as shafts, gears, or other friction points.
*   **Overall Lubrication System:** The high particulate count, presence of dirt/fiber, and elevated water content indicate systemic contamination affecting the entire lubricated circuit, including the reservoir and all wetted components.

**Characteristics:**

*   **Severity:** The overall condition is designated as "CR√çTICO" (Critical) by the analysis report, highlighting an urgent and severe issue.
*   **Wear Pattern:** Wear is characterized by both severe abrasive mechanisms (e.g., due to hard particles) and localized fatigue, indicating a combination of mechanical stresses. The "increase" in Copper and Lead suggests a progressive wear trend.
*   **Contamination Levels:** Particulate contamination is exceptionally high (ISO 4406: 22/20/17), indicating a severely dirty system. Water content (1050 ppm) is critically elevated for turbine oil, posing risks of corrosion and lubricant degradation.
*   **Lubricant Property:** A measurable and significant 15% increase in viscosity is observed, which will negatively impact lubricant flow, cooling, and film thickness, thereby exacerbating wear.

**Failure Analysis Observation Report**

**Subject:** Microscopic Analysis of Steel Wear Particles from Metallurgical Equipment

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Observations:**

The analysis of collected wear particles reveals two distinct morphologies, indicating different active wear mechanisms within the metallurgical equipment. The images provided are at 500x magnification.

**1. Fatigue-Generated Steel Particles (Top Image):**

*   **Visible Damage**:
    *   **Wear**: Presence of detached, irregular steel particles.
    *   **Fractures/Delamination**: The dominant particle morphology is flaky or laminar, characteristic of material delamination from a surface. Edges appear rough and fractured.
    *   **Discoloration/Inclusions**: Several particles exhibit internal darker spots (dark brown to black) and yellowish-brown areas, suggesting the presence of embedded foreign material, oxidation, or subsurface defects/inclusions within the original material.
*   **Location**: These are free-standing wear particles collected from the equipment's lubricant or wear surfaces, not observed on a component surface directly.
*   **Characteristics**:
    *   **Size**: Particle sizes are observed up to approximately 88 microns, indicating significant material loss events.
    *   **Shape**: Predominantly irregular, flat, and thin (laminar/flaky) fragments. Some blocky characteristics are also visible.
    *   **Color**: Primarily metallic silver-grey with areas of localized discoloration (dark brown/black, yellowish).
    *   **Quantity**: Individual, relatively large particles are sparsely distributed, though several are within the field of view.

*   **Inference**: The morphology and size of these particles are consistent with fatigue wear, typically associated with rolling contact fatigue in bearings, gears, or other components subjected to repeated cyclic loading. The internal discoloration suggests possible material inclusions, localized overheating, or oxidation prior to detachment.

**2. Entrainment/Scuffing-Generated Steel Particles (Bottom Image):**

*   **Visible Damage**:
    *   **Wear**: Abundant quantity of finely comminuted steel particles.
    *   **Comminution**: Particles appear fragmented, chunky, and granular, suggesting a severe abrasive or adhesive wear process where material is continuously sheared or torn away.
*   **Location**: These are free-standing wear particles, densely clustered.
*   **Characteristics**:
    *   **Size**: Particle sizes are significantly smaller, indicated to be up to approximately 8 microns.
    *   **Shape**: Irregular, angular, and granular fragments, with less of the flaky appearance seen in the fatigue particles.
    *   **Color**: Predominantly bright metallic silver-grey, highly reflective, with less pronounced discoloration compared to the fatigue particles.
    *   **Quantity**: Extremely high density of particles, forming distinct parallel streaks or agglomerations across the field of view. This indicates a high rate of material removal.
    *   **Pattern**: Particles are arranged in elongated, dense, parallel formations, possibly due to magnetic alignment during collection or specific flow characteristics.

*   **Inference**: The small, numerous, and granular nature of these particles, along with their high concentration and arrangement, is indicative of severe adhesive wear (scuffing/galling), abrasive wear, or severe sliding wear (entrainment) conditions. This could arise from lubrication breakdown, excessive contact pressure, or particulate contamination leading to continuous material removal.

**Summary:**

The presence of both large, flaky fatigue particles and small, numerous, granular entrainment/scuffing particles indicates multiple concurrent and potentially severe wear mechanisms within the metallurgical equipment. This suggests either a complex operational environment or deteriorating component health where both subsurface fatigue and surface-contact related wear are active. Further analysis of the specific components from which these particles originated would be necessary to pinpoint the exact failure sources.

## üìö Failure History Correlation
**Current Failure Analysis:**
The current failure describes "abnormal heating in the bearings, accompanied by excessive noise and vibration above the limit" on Centrifugal Pump BC-14. This set of symptoms (heating, noise, vibration, specifically in the bearings) is highly indicative of bearing distress or failure. The core issue appears to be centered around the bearings and their operational condition.

**Most Relevant Historical Failures:**

-   **Historical Failure 8:** CAUSE: BEARING WEAR (CENTRIFUGAL PUMP BC-14).
    -   **Relevance:** This historical failure is highly relevant because "bearing wear" (Desgaste de Rolamento) is the direct underlying condition that manifests as the current failure's symptoms: abnormal heating, excessive noise, and vibration in the bearings. Understanding the causes and contributing factors to bearing wear (as explored in its 5 Whys and Ishikawa diagrams) provides direct insight into what might be occurring in the current case, even if bearing wear is itself a consequence of other issues.
    -   **Relevant Data:** The historical failure occurred on: (Date not provided in the prompt, will indicate N/A).
        -   **Root Cause Concluded by Engineers:** Bearing wear associated with procedural and control gaps.
        -   **Defined Action Plan:** Review stock and assembly procedure to avoid inadequate pre-load.

-   **Historical Failure 1:** CAUSE: LUBRICATION FAILURE IN THE BEARING (CENTRIFUGAL PUMP BC-14).
    -   **Relevance:** Lubrication failure is a primary and very common root cause for bearing wear, which directly leads to increased friction, abnormal heating, excessive noise, and high vibration. This historical case offers critical insight into potential underlying causes for the current bearing symptoms, highlighting issues like inadequate lubrication, incorrect lubricant, or problems with the lubrication system.
    -   **Relevant Data:** The historical failure occurred on: (Date not provided in the prompt, will indicate N/A).
        -   **Root Cause Concluded by Engineers:** Lubrication failure in the bearing associated with procedural and control gaps.
        -   **Defined Action Plan:** Review and standardize the equipment's lubrication plan.

-   **Historical Failure 7:** CAUSE: INCORRECT COUPLING ALIGNMENT (CENTRIFUGAL PUMP BC-14).
    -   **Relevance:** Incorrect coupling alignment is a significant external mechanical factor that induces excessive vibration and noise, and places undue stress and load on the bearings. This increased load leads to premature bearing wear and, consequently, abnormal heating. This historical case provides a crucial technical correlation for mechanical stresses that could be driving the current observed symptoms.
    -   **Relevant Data:** The historical failure occurred on: (Date not provided in the prompt, will indicate N/A).
        -   **Root Cause Concluded by Engineers:** Incorrect coupling alignment associated with procedural and control gaps.
        -   **Defined Action Plan:** Standardize laser alignment after any mechanical intervention.

## ü§ñ Raw Response
```markdown
```
**Ishikawa Diagram**
- Material: [Contaminated lubricant supply, Incorrect lubricant type or viscosity]
- Machine: [Defective or worn bearing seals, Incorrect coupling alignment causing overload]
- Method: [Improper bearing installation procedure (e.g., pre-load), Inadequate contamination control during lubrication]
- Manpower: [Insufficient training on precision lubrication, Lack of awareness of alignment standards]
- Environment: [High ambient humidity leading to water ingress, Presence of abrasive dust and dirt particles]
- Measurement: [Lack of a routine oil analysis program, Inadequate vibration monitoring frequency]

**5 Whys**
- Why did the bearing assembly catastrophically fail (heating, noise, vibration)? Because it suffered from severe abrasive wear, surface fatigue, and overheating due to a complete breakdown of the lubrication film.
- Why did the lubrication film break down? Because the lubricant was critically contaminated with solid particles (dirt/fibers) and a high concentration of water (1050 ppm), which displaced the oil and abraded the surfaces.
- Why was the lubricant so severely contaminated? Because the bearing housing seals failed to prevent the ingress of environmental contaminants (moisture and dust).
- Why were the seals ineffective? Due to a combination of normal wear and potential damage from excessive vibration, which was likely exacerbated by a pre-existing or developing misalignment issue.
- Why was the incipient failure (contamination, misalignment) not detected and corrected earlier? Because of inadequate condition monitoring practices, such as routine oil analysis and vibration checks, which would have identified the contamination and mechanical stress before catastrophic failure.

**Action Plan**
- Immediately replace the failed bearing, shaft seals, and contaminated lubricant. During reassembly, perform a precision laser alignment of the pump and motor coupling.
- Implement a standardized lubrication procedure that includes strict contamination control measures, such as using dedicated sealed transfer containers and filtering new oil before use.
- Establish a formal condition monitoring program that includes monthly oil sampling for analysis (particle count, water content, wear metals) and routine vibration analysis to detect early signs of mechanical or lubrication-related faults.

**Final Conclusion**
The root cause of the catastrophic failure of the BC-14 bearing assembly was a complete loss of lubrication integrity due to severe contamination by water and solid abrasive particles. This contamination, which entered the system through ineffective seals, led to accelerated abrasive wear, surface fatigue, and subsequent overheating. Recurring historical failures related to lubrication, alignment, and bearing wear suggest systemic deficiencies in maintenance procedures and a lack of proactive condition monitoring, which allowed the degradation to progress to a catastrophic state.
